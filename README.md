# Quick Add Meal - React Native App

A production-ready React Native application for tracking meals and nutrition with a focus on clean architecture, TypeScript best practices, and optimal performance.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Search**: Diacritic and case-insensitive food search with priority ranking
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Real-time calorie and protein totals
- **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage with daily meal tracking
- **Visual Analytics**: Sparkline chart for calorie trend visualization
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with custom hooks and utilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Separation of Concerns**: 
- Search logic is separate from state management (`useTodayMeals` hook)
- Normalization utilities are isolated for testability
- UI components are pure and focused on presentation

**State Management**:
- Custom hook (`useTodayMeals`) for meal management
- AsyncStorage persistence with date-based keys (`meals:YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

**Search Implementation**:
- **Normalization**: Unicode NFD normalization for diacritic-insensitive matching
- **Priority Ranking**: Starts-with matches prioritized over contains matches
- **Performance**: Debounced search with 300ms delay

**Data Visualization**:
- Raw calorie data returned from hook for sparkline
- SVG-based sparkline with proportional scaling
- Manual rendering without external chart libraries

### Key Technical Choices

1. **TypeScript Excellence**: Comprehensive type definitions with strict typing
2. **Performance Optimization**: Debounced search, memoized components, FlatList virtualization
3. **Testing Readiness**: Separated concerns make unit testing straightforward
4. **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets, semantic elements, and contrast ratios
5. **Maintainability**: Clean folder structure, reusable components, consistent patterns

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- iOS: Xcode 14+
- Android: Android Studio with SDK tools
- CocoaPods (for iOS)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TapHealth
   npm install

Install iOS dependencies:

cd ios && pod install && cd ..

Start the application:

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on iOS (new terminal)
npm run ios

# Run on Android (new terminal)
npm run android








<!-- This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
